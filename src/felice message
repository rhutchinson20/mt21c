I sent the full score of the Hildegard Antiphons - all of them together are too long, and I think the first one alone will be fine if Dawn or one of her students would like to tackle it — however, I’d love to have Dawn have the whole set (a recording of them will be released ca. Feb, too).

Best of luck with all of the organization and selection!
Thanks again,

Franco
