                <p>m<chord mode="major"/>7 Chord: In addition to the five common seventh chord types, jazz includes use of the minor-major seventh chord (a minor triad with a major seventh). This chord will commonly have a ninth added as well. You will see the <q>major</q> symbol (<chord mode="major"/>) used primarily in jazz. Popular music typically uses <q>maj</q> instead.</p>

For this reason, we will use C9(13)<mdash/>to specify C<ndash/>E<ndash/>G<ndash/>B<flat/><ndash/>D<ndash/>A<mdash/>instead of C13, which would be used in the real world to describe these notes. In the real world, a composer or arranger writing C13 will assume the pianist or guitarist knows to omit the unaltered 11th because it clashes with the major 3rd of the chord. In this music theory course we will be specific as to which notes are included and left out.</p>

                <p>Enharmonic respelling: Jazz musicians will sometimes respell double-flatted notes and double-sharped notes enharmonically because for some musicians theory was viewed more from the aspect of the piano than the staff. This may at times include enharmonically respelling notes like B<sharp/>, C<flat/>, E<sharp/>, and F<flat/> (although these notes sometimes will be used).</p>

                <p>Root, 3rd, and 7th of dominant seventh chord remain unchanged.</p>

                <p>5th may be raised or lowered (<sharp/>5 or <flat/>5, which can also be written with pluses and minuses as <chord mode="augmented"/>5 or <ndash/>5) and can be respelled enharmonically (the <sharp/>5 of a C7<sharp/>5 could be written as an A<flat/> instead of G<sharp/>) for ease of reading because the chromatic spelling agrees with B<flat/> (the 7th of the chord)<mdash/>it is easier to read a chord where the accidentals agree (all sharps or all flats).</p>

            <li>
                <p>9th may be raised or lowered (<sharp/>9 or <flat/>9, which can also be written in the lead-sheet symbol as &#x002B;9 or <ndash/>9).  The <sharp/>9 is often spelled enharmonically on the staff as <flat/>10 for ease of reading; therefore, a dominant seventh chord with a <sharp/>9 will appear to have both a major and minor 3rd (C<ndash/>E<ndash/>G<ndash/>B<flat/><ndash/>E<flat/>). You may be tempted to call such a chord a minor chord with a <flat/>11, but <flat/>11 is not used because it is the major third of a chord.</p>

                <p><flat/>13 is the enharmonic equivalent of the <sharp/>5. In this text, <sharp/>5 is preferred to <flat/>13, but you will see both on lead sheets. Also, <flat/>13 implies that the unaltered 5th occurs in the chord, while <sharp/>5 does not.</p>

        <p>If you are composing or arranging and want to know when to use altered chords, know that dominant sevenths are usually altered (with altered 5th or 9th or both) when they have dominant function (i.e., when the root is going to resolve down by a fifth). Dominant sevenths are often unaltered when they have tonic function, i.e., the first chord in a blues.</p>

        <title>How to Write Jazz Chords</title>
        <p>To write a jazz chord after being given a lead-sheet symbol, begin with all of the major notes up to the 13th.</p>
        <p>Let’s work through this with the following label: Dm<chord mode="major"/>11.</p>
        <p>Dm means D<ndash/>F<ndash/>A. The <chord mode="major"/>11 means there is a major 7th, regular 9th, and regular 11th, not that there is a major 11th. Remember, D11 would mean a D7 chord with the 9 and 11 (all chord members up to the 11th<mdash/>D, F<sharp/>, A, C, E, G). D<chord mode="major"/>11 would mean a D<chord mode="major"/>7 chord with all members up to the 11 (D, F<sharp/>, A, C<sharp/>, E, G).</p>

        </sidebyside>
        <p>Let’s try this with another chord: E7<chord><alteration><sharp/>11</alteration><alteration><sharp/>9</alteration><alteration><sharp/>5</alteration></chord>.</p>
        <p>E7 means we have E<ndash/>G<sharp/><ndash/>B<ndash/>D. When we look at the altered notes, we see <sharp/>5, so we add a B<sharp/>, then change it to a C<natural/> because that agrees chromatically with the 7th, D. When we add <sharp/>9, we add F<doublesharp/>, which looks overly complicated, so we enharmonically respell it as G<natural/>, which agrees chromatically with the D (7th) and C (<sharp/>5). The <sharp/>11 can be an A<sharp/>, an augmented 2nd above the G (the <sharp/>9), or we can respell it as a B<flat/>. Both A<sharp/> and B<flat/> are acceptable, although the upper notes of D<ndash/>G<ndash/>B<flat/> form a G minor triad and therefore are easy to sightread. </p>

        <p>Work through each step (see the example below). Compare this chord to the scratch paper version with all the major notes up to the 13th. We have an E<flat/> dominant 7th chord. The G<flat/> can’t be the minor third because we already have a G<natural/>. If we consider the G<flat/> enharmonically as an F<sharp/>, we see we have a <sharp/>9, which we noted earlier is often spelled as  <flat/>10 so as to agree chromatically with the <flat/>7. The A is the 11th, but it is an A<natural/>, so it is a <sharp/>11.  It is not <flat/>5 because we would not have both a perfect 5th and altered 5th in the same chord. There is no C in the chord, so there isn’t a 13th.</p>

        <p>We notice we don’t have an A, and we remember that we might have a sus chord where the 4 (or sus4) substitutes for the 3rd. We see we have a B<flat/>, which confirms this. We also do not see a C, but we remember that it is common to omit the 5th in a chord (see <xref ref="IncompleteChords" text="title">Incomplete Chords</xref>). Therefore we have F<ndash/>B<flat/><ndash/>E<flat/>, making an F7sus chord. When we examine for upper structure notes (the 9, 11, and 13), we find a G<flat/> (the <flat/>9 of the chord) and a D (the 13). Remember, the B<flat/> is the sus (the 4th), not the 11th, because we have no 3rd (see <xref ref="ElevenVsSus" text="title">11 versus Sus</xref>).</p>
        <p>The final label is F13sus(<flat/>9).</p>
        <p><q>F13</q> means we have root, 3rd, 5th, <flat/>7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th. <q>Sus</q> is a modifier that means we have the 4th, which eliminates the 3rd as well as the 11th because <q>sus</q> and 11 refer the same note (B<flat/>). <q><flat/>9</q> means the 9th is lowered chromatically.</p>

            <title>III<ndash/>VI<ndash/>II<ndash/>V</title>
            <p>The iii<ndash/>vi<ndash/>ii<ndash/>V progression is called a <term>turnaround</term><idx><h>turnaround</h></idx> because it replaces the static harmony of the I chord in the last two measures of a tune with harmonic motion that leads to the I chord that will occur upon repetition to the top of the form. This also applies to the I<ndash/>VI<ndash/>II<ndash/>V progression.</p>
            <p>One can modify a iii<ndash/>vi<ndash/>ii<ndash/>V turnaround so all four chords are dominant seventh chords: III<chord bps="7"/><ndash/>VI<chord bps="7"/><ndash/>II<chord bps="7"/><ndash/>V<chord bps="7"/> (or V<chord bps="7"/>/vi<ndash/>V<chord bps="7"/>/ii<ndash/>V<chord bps="7"/>/V<ndash/>V<chord bps="7"/><mdash/>E<chord bps="7"/><ndash/>A<chord bps="7"/><ndash/>D<chord bps="7"/><ndash/>G<chord bps="7"/> in lead sheet symbols). Turnarounds made solely of dominant seventh chords can them employ tritone substitutions (substituting a dominant seventh chord a tritone away because they have the same guide tones). For example, E<chord bps="7"/><ndash/>A<chord bps="7"/><ndash/>D<chord bps="7"/><ndash/>G<chord bps="7"/> becomes E<chord bps="7"/><ndash/><em>E</em><flat/><chord bps="7"/><ndash/>D<chord bps="7"/><ndash/><em>D</em><flat/><chord bps="7"/>.</p>

        <introduction>
            <p>To discover a chord-scale relationship for almost any chord, write all of the notes of the chord (including upper extensions and altered notes), then fill in the thirds with the most logical choices, <em>avoiding augmented seconds and consecutive half steps</em>.</p>
            <p>In the example below, we determine the scale that best fits <chord root="G" mode="major" bps="7"><alteration><sharp/>11</alteration></chord> by doing the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Identify the notes in the chord</p></li>
                <li><p>Write all chord tones as a scale within the span of an octave</p></li>
                <li><p>Fill in any gaps, avoiding augmented 2nds and consecutive half steps</p></li>
                <li><p>Analyze the resulting scale</p></li>

            <title>List of Chord-Scale Relationships</title>
            <p>Below is a list of common chord-scale relationships. When there are two scales listed for a single chord, it is because the chord has a minor third that can be filled with half step then whole step <em>or</em> whole step then half step. This knowledge of chord-scale relationships ultimately becomes second nature to an improvising jazz musician.</p>

        <conclusion>
            <p>This list is not exhaustive. Follow the process above (<q>How to Determine Chord-Scale Relationships</q>) for chords not listed in this list.</p>
            <p>Additionally, it is often important to look at the relationship of a chord to the overall key of a tune to determine the appropriate scale. For example, the <chord root="F" mode="min" bps="7"/> at the beginning of <q>All The Things You Are</q> by Jerome Kern is the <chord root="vi" bps="7"/> chord in A<flat/> major, in which case it would be inappropriate to play an F Dorian scale because the D<natural/> would conflict with the D<flat/> in the key signature. One would play an F natural minor (or Aeolian) scale instead.</p>

        <p>Notice that all of the non-tonic chords are <chord root="vii" mode="diminished" bps="7"/> chords in various inversions.</p>
        <p>One hears a similar approach to harmonizing a scale (though without the fully-diminished seventh chords as passing chords) in the following example.</p>

In the second example, use Root<ndash/>3rd<ndash/>7th or Root<ndash/>7th<ndash/>3rd always for the lowest three voices, then realize the rest of the lead sheet symbol with the upper two parts (<q>spread</q> voicing). Use Root<ndash/>3rd<ndash/>6th for 6th chords and Root<ndash/>4th<ndash/>7th for sus chords. You may need to omit the 5th to maintain five parts throughout.</p>
