<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The rise of minimalism in the 1960s was a significant development in art music. While four artists are typically associated with minimalism—La Monte Young (b. 1935), Terry Riley (b. 1935), Phillip Glass (b. 1937), Steve Reich (b. 1936)—we  will focus on just two techniques in this chapter. The first, additive minimalism, is associated with the early minimalist pieces by Philip Glass. The second, phase shifting, is associated with Steve Reich.</p>
