<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The ideas in “the Manifesto,” as it is often called—that colleges need to train students to be composer–performer–improvisers (and I would add “arrangers”) like Bach and Beethoven as well as Charlie Parker and Jimmy Page—resonated with my musical experience growing up, which included writing, arranging, and playing popular music on electric guitar, electric bass, keyboards, and drumset in high school—both in my uncle’s home recording studio and with a garage band I formed. It also resonated with my experiences playing jazz and fusion as a professional bassist ever since I was in college, a situation where the majority of the basslines I play are improvised from lead-sheet symbols.</p>
