<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Whereas normal form deals with the exact pitches as they occur in the music, <dfn class="terminology">prime form</dfn> is usually a transposition and possibly an inversion of the normal form to its most essential form, much in the way an E♭ major triad in second inversion belongs to the category “major triad,” or a G\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\)/F belongs to the more general idea “dominant seventh chord.” Perhaps because of the primacy of C in music theory—many ideas are demonstrated in their relation to the C major scale—all prime forms are transposed to and start on C (pitch integer 0).</p>
