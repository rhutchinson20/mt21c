<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In the final example of this section, Schubert reinterprets a \(\left.\text{G}^♯{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\) in G minor as an \(\left.\text{E}^♯{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\) chord in B minor (\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{6}_{5}\middle/\text{V}\right.\)). The \(\left.\text{G}^♯{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\) chord in G minor is analyzed as \(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{4}_{2}\middle/\text{iv}\right.\), meaning it could resolve to a C minor chord, but it could also have been interpreted as \(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{4}_{3}\middle/\text{VI}\right.\), or as tonicizing an E♭ major chord. Because the chord never resolves in G minor, one cannot be certain of the intended resolution. Remember that diminished triads are not tonicized, so the \(\left.\text{G}^♯{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\) would not be considered as tonicizing the note A (the root of the \(\left.\text{ii}^{\circ}{}\right.\) chord) or F♯ (the root of the \(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\) chord).</p>
