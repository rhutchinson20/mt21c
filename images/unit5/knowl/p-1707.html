<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><dfn class="terminology">Set theory</dfn> is the analytical technique we will use to analyze expressionist music. The primary composers associated with expressionism are Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951), Anton Webern (1883–1945), and Alban Berg (1885–1935). In this text, we will associate <dfn class="terminology">atonal music</dfn>—music that avoids traditional harmonies and scales—with expressionism. Instead of scales and chords, intervals are the building blocks of Expressionist music. Although composers began writing atonal music in 1908, there was no widely-accepted systematic analytical approach that could show relationships between different pieces until Allen Forte published his seminal <span class="booktitle">The Structure of Atonal Music</span> in 1973, in which Forte applied set theory mathematics to music. However, our approach to normal form and prime form will follow the slightly-modified approach set out by John Rahn  in his <span class="booktitle">Basic Atonal Theory</span> (1980), which is the approach followed by Joseph Straus  in his well-known and widely-used <span class="booktitle">Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory</span>.<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-6-hidden.html" title="Footnote 33.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a></p>
