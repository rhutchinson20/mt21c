<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">When notating seventh chords with Roman numerals, there are a few conventions to follow. An uppercase Roman numeral means a major triad and a lowercase Roman numeral means a minor triad. Adding “7” after a Roman numeral means there is a minor seventh between the root and seventh of the chord. Therefore, \(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\) means a major triad with a minor seventh between the root and seventh and \(\left.\text{vi}^{7}\right.\) means a minor triad and a minor seventh between the root and seventh. Add “M7” for a major seventh chord (e.g., \(\left.\text{I}\text{M}^{7}\right.\)). The half-diminished symbol (\(\left.\text{}^ø{}^{7}\right.\)) means there is a diminished triad with a minor seventh from root to seventh. The diminished symbol (\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\)) on a seventh chord means the triad is diminished and the distance from the root to seventh is a diminished seventh.</p>
